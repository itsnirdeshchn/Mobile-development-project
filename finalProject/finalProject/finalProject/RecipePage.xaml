                       This butter stays harder than the higher fat European butter which softens much faster when rolling out.
                       Bread Flour is used for its stregnth and crispness. All things being equal, I find it rises higher than all-purpose flour and produces a crisper, flakier pastry.
                       Salt enhances the taste of the baked pastry.
                       Sour cream sometimes has liquid in it. Make sure to pour that off and only use the firm part." />
